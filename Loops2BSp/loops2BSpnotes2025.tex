These are Ravi's notes, for Jim, but also to set some notation.

\epoint{The space $V$}

We start with a vector space $\boxed{V}$ with an alternating form. 
(I expect everything I type here to work fine for $O$ in place of $Sp$  with change of signs, but I stick to the symplectic case for concreteness and to avoid confusion.) 
Choosing a splitting $V = L \oplus L^*$ is called a polarization or Lagrangian splitting. Jim says it is a "Weinstein normal form".

More generally, we can work over an arbitrary base, and all statements will behave well with respect to base change.
So most generally, we work over $\Spec \Z$, and $V$ is a free sheaf on $\Spec \Z$ of rank $2n$, etc.  I will continue to use vector space language for simplicity.


\section{Background on the symplectic affine Grassmannian}


\epoint{The loop space of $V$}

The loop space of $V$ is
$$\boxed{H} = \boxed{V((z))} \coloneq V[[z]] \oplus z^{-1} V[ z^{-1}].$$


We define
$\boxed{H^+} = V[[z]]$ and $\boxed{H^-} = z^{-1} V[ z^{-1}]$.
$H$ has a residue pairing:  
$$\boxed{\langle f(z), g(z) \rangle} \coloneq \operatorname{Res}_{z=0}  \omega(f(-z), g(z)) \; dz.$$
This residue pairing is skew-symmetric and nondegenerate.
$H$ is thought of as some sort of infinite-dimensional symplectic Hilbert space.


{\em Question:} what's the reason for the sign in pairing?  
I think in our pairing (see later on), there is no sign.


\epoint{The Lagrangian Sato Grassmannian} 

The Lagrangian Sato Grassmannian parametrizes "Lagrangians" of the loop space that are close to $H^+$.
It is contained in the index zero component of the (usual --- not symplectic) Sato Grassmannian (not defined here).
The Lagrangian Sato Grassmannian  is often denoted $\LGr_\infty$ (or $LGr(H)$).  I will use temporary notation $\boxed{\LSG}$ to remind us of its meaning. (This is a macro which can be easily changed.)


The $N$th truncation is denoted $\boxed{\LSG^{(N)}} = \LSG^{(N)}(H)$, and is isomorphic to $$LG(N \dim V, 2N \dim V).$$
We can show that $\LSG_\infty$ is the limit of $LGr(nN, 2nN)$ in our naive homotopy category.   Thus its homotopy type is $LGr(\infty, 2 \infty) = U/O = \Omega(Sp)$.

Remark:
This will likely be relevant for us, because we will be "increasing $V$" which will be changing the symplectic affine Grassmannian, but the ambient Lagrangian Sato Grassmannian (even for finite $V$) will be what we want.  

\epoint{The symplectic affine Grassmannian}

The symplectic affine Grassmannian is the $z$-stable locus inside the Lagrangian Sato Grassmannian.
The symplectic affine Grassmannian is  unfortunately 
often denoted  $Gr$ or $Gr_{Sp_{2n}}$ or $Gr_{Sp}$. I will use temporary notation $\boxed{\SAG}$ to remind us.  This is a temporary macro which can be easily changed.

Fact:  $\SAG_{Sp(V)}$ is homotopic to $\Omega(Sp(V))$.

Vague argument (that I've not thought through):    $L Sp(V)$ parametrizes maps from loops to $Sp(V)$ --- smooth maps from $S^1$.  $\boxed{L^+} =L^+(V)$ is the subset where the map extends holomorphically to the disk.  Then show that $L/L^+ \cong LGr$, by describing a transitive action of $L$, and identifying the stabilizer as $L^+$.  But $L^+$ is contractible.  (Presumably I should look at \cite{ps} for more. It might be in a later paper of  Nadler, perhaps \cite{nadler}, see one of the references of \cite{zhu}.)   (There is an argument of this sort in the algebraic category, involving algebraic loops; and also in the continuous category.)

\epoint{Truncations of the symplectic affine Grassmannian}
The $N$th truncation of the symplectic affine Grassmannian is 
called $\boxed{\SAG_{Sp}^{(N)}} = \Gr^{(N)}$.  (Caution:  I am worried that the terminology  $\Gr$  gets used both for the affine and the Sato case.)

\epoint{Singularities of the truncation}
Apparently $\SAG^{(N)}$  is singular in codimension $\dim V$, with possible reference  \cite{mov}. 


\section{Moduli of vector bundles with symplectic structure}

Now let $\boxed{\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))}$  be the moduli space of vector bundles on $\proj^1$, framed at $p_\infty$ by $V$, with its form.

Let $\boxed{\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}}$ parametrize those bundles $\cF$ such that $\cF(N)$ is globally generated. For example, 
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$ is empty if $N<0$.

\epoint{Basic facts about this space}
The space 
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))$ 
is an Artin stack.  

 The space 
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))$ is an $Sp(2n)$ bundle over the "unframed" moduli space, which is also thus an Artin stack.  This latter space is smooth, because the automorphisms/deformation/obstructions of a principle bundle $E$ is given by the cohomology of the adjoint bundle $ad(E)$, so automorphisms are $H^0(ad(E))$, deformations are $H^1(ad(E))$, and obstructions are $H^2(ad(E))$, which in this case are zero.  (The adjoint bundle is the "twisted Lie algebra bundle", as I think Jim was telling me.)



The space 
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))$  is the union of an increasing sequence of open substacks
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$.

Each $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$ is quasicompact and finite type.  

$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[0]}$ is a reduced point.

The space of  bundles trivialized in a formalized neighborhood of $p_\infty$ is apparently, as an ind-scheme, the affine symplectic Grassmannian $\SAG{Sp(2n)}$.

\epoint{Sketch of why these things are true}
These are all well-known facts, but we will also end reproving them, so we can have confidence in these statements.  Here is the architecture of our argument.

First:
$\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))$ and $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$
are stacks in the usual (smooth etc.) topology (not yet obviously algebraic stacks).  

(ii) 
We construct a finite type affine scheme (explicitly, with generators and relations), that will parametrize the same things as  $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$, with in addition a Zariski-splitting.  This is an affine bundle  over $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$.  Thus $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))^{[N]}$ is an algebraic stack (i.e., an Artin stack).

We  have open embeddings of these truncations, and their union is  the entire space, so $\Omega^2_{alg}(BSp(2n))$ is an algebraic stack.




$\Omega^2_{alg}(B Sp(V))$ parametrizes the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item $\boxed{\cF}$ is a rank $2n$ vector bundle on $\proj^1$.  (Caution:  earlier the bundle on $\proj^1$ was considered to be rank $n$.)
\item  We have an identification $\cF|_{p_{\infty}} \overset \sim \longrightarrow V$
\item $\boxed{\phi_\cF}: \cF \overset \sim \longrightarrow \cF^\vee$ satisfying 
$\phi^\vee_\cF = -\phi_\cF$, and $\phi_{\cF}|_{p_\infty} = \phi_V$ (where $\phi_V$ comes
from the alternating form).    Or equivalently:  $\boxed{\psi_{\cF}}: \cF\otimes \cF \rightarrow \oh$,
with appropriate hypotheses.
\end{itemize}


\epoint{Comparison to topology}
I think we quote Cohen-Lupercio-Segal or someone else to show that smooth maps to $BSp(V)$ are homotopic to holomorphic maps to $BSp(V)$.
Then by GAGA (some justification needed) this is the same as algebraic maps to $BSp(V)$.

\point $\boxed{\Omega^2_{d,alg}(B Sp(V))}$ parametrizes the same, with the additional requirement that $\cF(d p_\infty)$ is
generated by global sections.  (Equivalently, when you write $\cF$ as a direct sum of line bundles, the summands
are all of degree between $-d$ and $d$ inclusive.  This interpretation is {\em not helpful}.)

We define $\boxed{\cE} = \cF (d p_{\infty})$ for convenience.  This bundle is rank $2n$ and 

We then have $\boxed{\phi_{\cE}} : \cE \rightarrow \cE^\vee(2d)$, and $\boxed{\psi_{\cE}} = \psi_{\cF}(2d) : \cE \otimes \cE \rightarrow \oh(2d p_{\infty})$.

\tpoint{Claim}
{\em We have an induced isomorphism $\cE|_{p_{\infty}} \overset \sim \longrightarrow V$.}

(Proof omitted.)

\epoint{Zariski-framing}

Define $\boxed{A}  \coloneq H^0(\cE(-p_\infty))$, which has dimension $2dn$.  

We now consider the Zariski-framed moduli space, which doesn't yet have a name.

The data of the Zariski-framed bundle $\cE$ is the data of $A$, plus $\al: A \rightarrow A$, and $j:A \rightarrow U$,
along with an {\em open condition} on $j$ and $\al$.

The following matrix (where we are treating elements of $A$ and $U$  as column vectors) is required
to be full rank for all $x \in \C$.

\begin{tabular}{|ccc|c}
  \hline
  & & & \\
  & $x \rm{Id}-\al$ & & $A$ \\
  & & & \\
\hline
& $j$ & & $U$ \\
\hline
& $A^\vee$ & &  \\
\end{tabular}

For each $x \in \C$, the locus where the matrix is not full rank is codimension $2n+1$.
Thus as $x$ varies, the locus where the matrix is not full rank is codimension $2n$.
(That's not quite rigorous.)


For future use, define $\jalpha: A \rightarrow t U[[t]]$ by
$$\jalpha(a) = ja t + j \al a t^2 + j \al^2 a t^3 + \cdots$$
This is the generating function for $j \al^{k-1} a$.

\tpoint{Claim}   {\em $\jalpha \pmod t^{2d+1}$ is an injection $A \hookrightarrow tU \oplus \cdots \oplus t^{2d} U$.
}

\epoint{Sketch of proof}

Consider $0 \rightarrow \cE(-2d-1) \rightarrow \cE(-1) \rightarrow \cE(-1)/\cE(-2d-1) \rightarrow 0.$
Now $\cE$ is the direct sum of line bundles with degrees at most $2d$,
so $H^0(\cE(-2d-1)=0$ from which
$$
H^0(\cE(-1)) \rightarrow H^0(\cE(-1)/ \cE(-2d-1))$$ is an  injection. \epf

Now $A$ has rank $2dn$, and  the right side has rank $4dn$.

\epoint{Recovering $(A, j, \al)$ from this subset of $t U \oplus \cdots \oplus t^{2d} U \oplus t^{2d+1} U$}

$A$ is just the subset.

$j$ is just $[t] \jalpha$.

Question:  how do we get $\alpha a$?
Put differently, if I tell you $j a$, \dots, $j \al^{2d-1} a$, can you tell me
$j \al^{2d} a$?
