\section{Introduction}\label{sec: intro}



\subsection{Algebraic and Topological double loop spaces and Bott periodicity.}

In this paper, we study the \emph{algebraic double loop space} of
Lagrangian Grassmannians and the orthogonal counter part. We define the
algebraic double loop space as follows.

\begin{definition}\label{defn: Omega2alg(X)}
Let $(X,*)$ be a variety with a base point $*\in X$. Fix homogeneous
coordinates $(x_{0}:x_{1})$ on $\PP^{1}$ with point at infinity
$p_{\infty}=(1:0)$. Let $\LoopTwo(X)$ be the space algebraic based
maps of degree $d$, that is
\[
\LoopTwo (X) = \left\{f:\PP^{1}\to X\text{ such that
$f(p_{\infty})=*$ and $f_{*}([\PP^{1}])=d\in H_{2}(X,\ZZ )$ } \right\} .
\]
\end{definition}

In the analytic topology over $\CC$, $\PP^{1}$ is homeomorphic to
$S^{2}$ and so there is an inclusion of the algebraic double loop
space into the usual double loop space studied in topology:
\[
i:\LoopTwo (X) \hookrightarrow \LoopTwoTop (X)
\]
where $\LoopTwoTop (X)$ is the space of continuous based maps of
degree $d$ (we will drop the $d$ from the notation when $H_{2}(X)=0$).

In the same spirit as using high degree polynomial functions to
approximate a continuous functions, we may hope that for certain
varieties $X$, the algebraic loop space approximates the topological
loop space in the sense that it captures most of its homotopy theory.

\begin{expectation}
For certain varieties $X$, 
\[
i:\LoopTwo (X) \hookrightarrow \LoopTwoTop
(X)
\]
is a \emph{homotopy approximation} meaning that 
\[
i_{*}:\pi_{k}(\LoopTwo (X)) \to \pi_{k}( \LoopTwoTop (X))
\]
is an isomorphism for all $k<B(d,X)$ and that $B\to \infty $ as $d\to
\infty$. 
\end{expectation}

In the 1980's and 1990's the above expectation was shown to hold for
generalized flag varieties in a series of papers by Segal, Kirwan,
Mann-Milgram, and Boyer-Mann-Hurtubise-Milgram,
\cite{Segal-1979,Kirwan-1986,Mann-Milgram-93,Boyer-Mann-Hurtubise-Milgram}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm: Mann-Milgram algebraic loop approximation
holds for generalized flag varieties}
Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group over $\CC$, let $P\subset G$
be a parabolic subgroup, and let $X=G/P$ be the corresponding
generalized flag variety. Then the above expectation holds.
\end{theorem}

The (topological) double loop space $\LoopTwoTop (X)$ plays an
important role in homotopy theory, for example in Bott periodicity. To
state the version of Bott periodicity we want, we recall that $U(n)$,
$Sp(2n)$, and $O(2n)$ are the classical compact Lie groups of unitary,
symplectic, and orthogonal transformations. We also have the infinite
dimensional versions of these groups (defined by direct limits of
inclusions) and their associated classifying spaces and homogeneous
spaces. For example:
\begin{align*}
U&=\lim_{n\to  \infty} U(n),\\
Sp/U& = \lim_{n\to  \infty} Sp(2n)/U(n),\\
BO& = \lim_{n\to  \infty} BO(n),\\
\end{align*}
and so forth.

One version of Bott periodicity is then given as follows.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{Bott-Periodicity-1959}]\label{thm: classical Bott periodicity as homotopy equivalences}
There exist the following homotopy equivalences:
\begin{align}
\LoopTwoTop (BU)&\homotopyeq BU \label{eqn: Omega2BU=BU}\\
\LoopTwoTop (Sp/U)&\homotopyeq BO  \label{eqn: Omega2Sp/U=BO}\\
\NoDLoopTwoTop (BO)&\homotopyeq O/U  \label{eqn: Omega2BO=O/U}\\
\LoopTwoTop (O/U)&\homotopyeq BSp  \label{eqn: Omega2O/U=BSp}\\
\NoDLoopTwoTop (BSp)&\homotopyeq Sp/U   \label{eqn: Omega2BSp=Sp/U}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

Equation~\eqref{eqn: Omega2BU=BU} is referred to as \emph{complex Bott
periodicity} and it implies that the homotopy groups of $U$ are
2-periodic. Equations~\eqref{eqn: Omega2Sp/U=BO}-\eqref{eqn: Omega2BSp=Sp/U} 
are referred to as \emph{real Bott periodicity} and they imply that
the homotopy groups of $O$ are 8-periodic.

\subsection{Summary of main results}

The main results of this paper give explicit descriptions of $\LoopTwo
(X)$ when $X$ is a Grassmanian, a Lagrangian Grassmanian, or a maximal
isotropic orthogonal Grassmanian. Our description is in terms of
moduli spaces of quiver representations. We use our descriptions along
with Theorem~\ref{thm: Mann-Milgram algebraic loop approximation
holds for generalized flag varieties} to give new proofs of the
homotopy equivalences \eqref{eqn: Omega2BU=BU}, \eqref{eqn:
Omega2Sp/U=BO}, and \eqref{eqn: Omega2O/U=BSp} and so we may regard
our theorems as finite dimensional, algebraic refinements of Bott
periodicity. The study of the remaining equivalences in the Bott
periodicity theorem from the perspective of this paper will be pursued
in future work.

To state our results more explicitly, let 
\[
\Gr(n,n+N) = U(n+N)/U(n)\times U(N)
\]
be the Grassmanian of $n$ dimensional quotients of a fixed $n+N$
dimensional vector space,  let
\[
\LGr (n,2n)= Sp(2n) /U(n)
\]
be the Lagrangian Grassmanian
which parameterizes $n$ dimensional Lagrangian quotients of a fixed
$2n$ dimensional symplectic vector space, and let
\[
\OGr (n,2n) = O(2n)/U(n)
\]
be the Isotropic Orthogonal Grassmanian which parameterizes $n$
dimensional isotropic quotients of a fixed $2n$ dimensional orthogonal
vector space. Let $X$ be any of the above homogeneous spaces. Then $X$
is a projective variety of Picard number 1 and so the class of a based
map $f:\PP^{1}\to X$ may be regarded as a non-negative integer (the
degree).



\begin{theorem}\label{thm: quiver description of Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))}
Let $A$ be a vector space of dimension $d$ and let $U,W$ be vector
spaces of dimension $n$ and $N$ respectively. Let
\[
V=V_{n,N,d} =\Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (W,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U).
\]
Then $GL(A)$ acts naturally on $V$ and let $V^{\stable}\subset V$ be
the locus of points which are stable in the sense of Geometric
Invariant Theory (with respect to the trivial linearization). Then
there exists a natural isomorphism:
\[
\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))\cong V^{\stable}/GL(A).
\]
\end{theorem}

For the Lagrangian and isotropic orthogonal Grassmannians we have the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(LGr)}
Let $A$ be a vector space of dimension $d$ equipped with a
non-degenerate orthogonal form $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$ (so
$\phi^{\vee}=\phi$) and let $U$ be a vector space of dimension
$n$. Let
\[
V=V_{n,d}=\left\{(\alpha ,j)\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U):
\alpha^{\vee}\phi =\phi \alpha \right\} 
\]
and let 
\[
O(A,\phi ) = \left\{g\in GL(A):g^{\vee}\phi g=\phi  \right\}
\]
be the group of orthogonal isomorphisms of $A$. Then $O(A,\phi )$ acts
naturally on $V$ and let $V^{\stable}\subset V$ be the stable
locus (in the sense of GIT). Then
\[
\LoopTwo (\LGr(n,2n))\cong V^{\stable}/O(A,\phi ). 
\]
\end{theorem}

The statement for the isotropic orthogonal Grassmannian is similar:


\begin{theorem}\label{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(OGr)}
Let $A$ be a vector space of dimension $d$ equipped with a
non-degenerate symplectic form $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$ (so
$\phi^{\vee}=-\phi$) and let $U$ be a vector space of dimension
$n$. Let
\[
V=V_{n,d}=\left\{(\alpha ,j)\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U):
\alpha^{\vee}\phi =\phi \alpha \right\} 
\]
and let 
\[
Sp(A,\phi ) = \left\{g\in GL(A):g^{\vee}\phi g=\phi  \right\}
\]
be the group of symplectic isomorphisms of $A$. Then $Sp(A,\phi )$ acts
naturally on $V$ and let $V^{\stable}\subset V$ be the stable
locus (in the sense of GIT). Then
\[
\LoopTwo (\OGr(n,2n))\cong V^{\stable}/Sp(A,\phi ). 
\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Topological Consequences}\label{subsec: topological consequences}

We now explain how our quiver descriptions of the algebraic loops
spaces of  $\Gr (n,n+N)$, $\OGr(n,2n)$, and $\LGr(n,2n)$
lead to proofs of the Bott periodicity equivalences given by
eqns~\eqref{eqn: Omega2BU=BU}, \eqref{eqn: Omega2O/U=BSp}, and
\eqref{eqn: Omega2Sp/U=BO} respectively. Full details of the argument
will be supplied in \S~\ref{sec: topological details}. 

In \cite{Larson-Vakil-BottPeriodicity}, Larson and Vakil define,
$\HoG$ the ``homotopy category of algebraic spaces'' whose objects can
be given sequences 
\[
\dotsb \to  X_{i} \to  X_{i+1}\to \dotsb 
\]
of highly connected maps of algebraic spaces or stacks. Objects in
their category have a topological realization which is a well-defined
homotopy type that one can think of as $\lim_{i\to \infty} X_{i}$ in
the complex analytic topology with the direct limit
topology. Isomorphisms in the category include compatible systems of
maps $X_{i} \to Y_{i}$ which are affine bundles, or which are more and
more highly connected as $i\to \infty$. The category $\HoG$ provides
an algebro-geometric arena where isomorphisms induce homotopy
equivalences on the complex analytic counter parts. It is particularly
well adapted for the algebraic loop spaces and the quiver descriptions
given in this paper.

The natural sequence
\[
\dotsb \to \Gr (n,n+N)\to \Gr (n+1,n+N+2)\to \dotsb 
\]
is an example of an object in $\HoG$. The topological realization of
this object has homotopy type
\[
\lim_{n,N\to \infty} U(n+N)/U(n)\times U(N) = BU.
\]
Applying $\LoopTwo (-)$ to the above sequence we get an object in
$\HoG$ 
\[
\dotsb \to \LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))\to \LoopTwo (\Gr (n+1,n+N+2))\to \dotsb 
\]
which we call $\LoopTwo (BU)$

There is a corresponding sequence of quiver moduli spaces
\[
\dotsb \to V^{\stable}_{n,N,d}/GL_{d} \to V^{\stable}_{n+1,N+1,d}/GL_{d} \to \dotsb 
\]
which we call $V^{\stable}_{\infty ,d}/GL_{d}$ and is isomorphic to
$\LoopTwo (BU)$ via the isomorphisms in Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver
description of Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))}. As we will show, the
maps $V^{\stable}_{n,N,d}\hookrightarrow V_{n,N,d}$ are more and more
connected as $n,N\to \infty$ and hence induce an isomorphism with the
corresponding sequence of stack quotients and give an isomorphism 
\[
V^{\stable}_{\infty ,d}/GL_{d} \cong [V_{\infty ,d} / GL_{d}]
\]
in $\HoG$. Then since
the map $V_{n,N,d}\to pt$ is an
affine bundle, it follows that this object is isomorphic to
$[pt/GL_{d}] =BGL_{d}$. Thus Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))} gives rise to an isomorphism in $\HoG$ 
\[
\LoopTwo (BU)\cong BGL_{d}. 
\]

It is not hard to define a sequence of maps that increase $d$ as well as $n$ and
$N$:
\[
\dotsb \to \LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))\to \Omega^{2}_{d+1,\alg} (\Gr (n+1,n+N+2))\to \dotsb 
\]
which we denote $\Omega^{2}_{\infty ,\alg}(BU)$. It is a consequence
of the Boyer-Mann-Hurtubise-Milgram theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm:
Mann-Milgram algebraic loop approximation holds for generalized flag
varieties}) that the topological realization of $\Omega^{2}_{\infty
,\alg}(BU)$ has the homotopy type of $\LoopTwoTop (BU)$ (for any fixed
$d$ since they are all homotopic to each other). Thus taking the
topological realization of the isomorphism
in $\HoG$ 
\[
\Omega^{2}_{\infty ,\alg } (BU)\cong BGL. 
\]
proves the homotopy equivalence
\[
\LoopTwoTop (BU)\homotopyeq BU .
\]

The identical argument may be applied to the isomorphisms in
Theorems~\ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm:
quiver description of Loop2Alg(OGr)}. Briefly, applying $\LoopTwo (-)$
to the sequence
\[
\dotsb \to Sp(2n)/U(n) \to Sp(2n+2)/U(n+1) \to \dotsb 
\]
we get an object $\LoopTwo (Sp/U)$ in $\HoG$ which by applying
Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(LGr)} and applying a
similar argument to above yields an isomorphism in $\HoG$:
\[
\LoopTwo (Sp/U) \cong BO(d) . 
\]
Similary, Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(OGr)}
yields an isomorphism
\[
\LoopTwo (O/U) \cong BSp(d) . 
\]
Finally, by constructing stabilization maps that increase $d$ as well
as $n$, we get isomorphisms
\[
\Omega^{2}_{\infty ,\alg } (Sp/U) \cong BO, \quad \Omega^{2}_{\infty ,\alg } (O/U) \cong BSp 
\]
whose topological realizations give the homotopy equivalences
\[
\LoopTwoTop (Sp/U)\homotopyeq BO, \quad \LoopTwoTop (O/U)\homotopyeq
BSp. 
\]



\section{Zariski Framed Sheaves, Quivers, and the Proof of
Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))}}\label{sec: Zariski framed sheaves, quivers, and
proof of Loop2(Gr) theorem}


The material in this section has previously appeared in other various
guises (e.g \cite[\S~5]{Larson-Vakil-BottPeriodicity}, \cite[\S~3]{Nakajima-Handsaw}),
but we include it to fix our notation and orient the reader to our
point of view which will be integral to subsequent sections.



We fix homogeneous coordinates $(x_{0}:x_{1})$ on $\PP^{1}$ and we let
$p_{\infty }=(1:0)$. Let $V$ be a vector space. We use the notation
\[
\UL{V}(k) = \OO_{\PP^{1}}(k)\otimes V
\]
and in general, we use underlines to denote sheaves and maps of
sheaves and we drop the underline to denote the induced map on cohomology.


Let $U$ and $W$ be vector spaces of dimension $n$ and $N$ respectively
and let
\[
\Gr (n,n+N) = \Gr (n,U\oplus W)
\]
be the Grassmannian of $n$ dimensional quotients of $U\oplus W$ with
basepoint given by the projection $U\oplus W\to U$. By pulling back
the universal quotient, we see that $\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))$
parameterizes exact sequences:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r]& F \arrow[r]& \UL{U}\oplus \UL{W} \arrow{r}{\UL{f} } &E
\arrow[r]& 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Here $E$ is a rank $n$, degree $d$ bundle on $\PP^{1}$ and
$E|_{p_{\infty}}\cong U$ via the first component of $\UL{f}$ which we
call $\UL{\theta}$. The second component of $\UL{f}$ is zero at
$p_{\infty}$ and hence factors as
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
 \UL{W} \arrow[r,"\UL{\gamma }"]& E(-p_{\infty})
 \arrow[r,"\UL{x}_{1}"] &E. 
\end{tikzcd}
\]
and so we may write
\[
\UL{f}
=({\UL{\theta}},\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma })
\]

By definition, the map $\UL{\theta}:\UL{U}\to E$ induces the framing
at $p_{\infty}$: $E|_{p_{\infty}}\cong U$ and moreover, it induces a
trivialization of $E$ on some (unspecified) Zariski open neighborhood
of $p_{\infty}$. We call such a structure a \emph{Zariski framing} of $E$.

\begin{definition}\label{defn: Zariski framing}
Let $E$ be a rank $n$ sheaf on $\PP^{1}$ and let $U$ be an $n$
dimensional vector space. A sheaf map
\[
\UL{\theta}: \UL{U}\to E
\]
is called a \emph{Zariski framing} if $\UL{\theta}|_{p_{\infty}}:U \to
E|_{p_{\infty}}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{definition}

The following theorem identifies the stack of Zariski framed sheaves
with the stack of representations of the following quiver:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\tikzset{myarrow/.style={-Latex, thick,line width=1pt,shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt}}

% Node positioning
\def\yDist{1.0} % Vertical distance between nodes
\def\loopRadius{0.6} % Radius of the loop circles

% Centered quiver
\node[draw, circle, fill, inner sep=1.5pt, label=below right:{\small $A$}] (R1) at (0,\yDist) {}; 
\node[draw, circle, fill, inner sep=1.5pt, label={right:{\small $U$}}] (R2) at (0,-\yDist) {}; 
\draw[myarrow] (R1) -- node[right] {\small $j$} (R2);

% Loop for top node
\draw[-Latex,thick] (0.17,\yDist) arc (-75:255:\loopRadius) node[midway, above] {\small $\alpha$}; 

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm: stack of Zariski framed sheaves is
equivalent to stack of quiver representation}
The stack of degree $d$ sheaves $E$ equipped with a Zariski framing
$\UL{\theta}: \UL{U}\to E$ is equivalent to the stack quotient
\[
[\,\,\Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U) \,/\, GL(A)\,\, ]
\]
where $A$ is a vector space of dimension $d$. Moreover, the open
substack where $E$ is locally free is a scheme and is given by the
open condition where 
\[
(\alpha ,j)\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U) 
\]
satisfy 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: open condition involving ker j}
\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\cap \Ker (j) = 0\text{ for all }\lambda \in \CC 
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\proof Since $\UL{U}$ is torsion free and $\UL{\theta}$ is generically
an isomorphism,
\[
\Ker \UL{\theta}=0\text{ and } \Coker \UL{\theta}=Q ,
\]
a zero dimensional length $d$ sheaf supported on $\AA=\PP^{1}-p_{\infty}$.

The sequence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r]& \UL{U} \arrow{r}{\UL{\theta}} & E\arrow[r]&Q\arrow[r]&0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
then induces the sequence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r]& {U} \arrow{r}{{\theta}} &H^{0}(E)\arrow[r]&H^{0}(Q)\arrow[r]&0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Using $\UL{\theta}|_{p_{\infty}}$ to identify $E|_{p_{\infty}}$ with
$U\otimes \OO_{p_{\infty}}$ we may write
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r]&E(-p_{\infty})\arrow{r}{\cdot \UL{x}_{1}}
&E\arrow[r]&U\otimes \OO_{p_{\infty}} \arrow[r] &0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
and hence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r]&H^{0}(E(-p_{\infty}))\arrow{r}{\cdot {x}_{1}}
&H^{0}(E)\arrow[r]&U \arrow[r] &0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The above sequence is split by $\theta$ so writing
$A=H^{0}(E(-p_{\infty}))$, we've identified
\begin{align*}
H^{0}(E) &= A\oplus U,\\
H^{0}(E(-1))&= A,\\
H^{0}(Q)&= A.
\end{align*}
Then the sheaf map
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
E(-1)\arrow{r}{\cdot \UL{x}_{0}}
&E
\end{tikzcd}
\]
induces a map in cohomology
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A\arrow{r}{\cdot x_{0}} &A\oplus U
\end{tikzcd}
\]
whose components we denote by $\alpha$ and $j$:
\[
\alpha :A\to A, \quad j: A\to U.
\]
The above construction induces a map 
\[
[\UL{\theta}:\UL{U}\to E]\mapsto (\alpha ,j)
\]
from the moduli stack of Zariski framed sheaves to the moduli stack of
quiver representations. To show this is an equivalence, we need a
reverse construction. The is proved via the following Lemma which can
be attributed to Str\o mme \cite[Prop~1.1]{Stromme} (although it is a
special case of the Beilinson spectral sequence).
\begin{lemma}\label{lem: Stromme}
Let $E$ be a sheaf on $\PP^{1}$ with $H^{1}(E(-1))=0$. Then the following
sequence is exact:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow{r} & \UL{H^{0}(E(-1))}(-1)
\arrow{rr}{\UL{x}_{1}x_{0}-\UL{x}_{0}x_{1}}& &
\UL{H^{0}(E)} \arrow{r} & E\arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where recalling our notation, sheaf maps are denoted with
underlines and their induced maps on cohomology are denoted without,
so in particular $\UL{x}_{i}:\OO (-1)\to \OO$ and
$x_{i}:H^{0}(E(-1))\to H^{0}(E)$ in the above.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\PP^{1}\times \PP^{1}$ have coordinates
$((y_{0}:y_{1}),(x_{0}:x_{1}))$ with $p,q:\PP^{1}\times \PP^{1}\to
\PP^{1}$ projection onto the first and second factor respectively. Let 
\[
\Delta =\{y_{1}x_{0}-y_{0}x_{1} =0 \}\subset \PP^{1}\times \PP^{1}
\]
be the diagonal. Then we get an isomorphism
\[
E\cong q_{*}\left(p^{*}E\otimes \OO_{\Delta} \right)
\]
where we have implicitly identified the two factors of $\PP^{1}$ by
$x_{i}=y_{i}$.  We then tensor the exact sequence
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r] & \OO_{\PP^{1}\times \PP^{1}}(-1,-1)
\arrow{rr}{y_{1}x_{0}-y_{0}x_{1}}& & \OO_{\PP^{1}\times \PP^{1}}
\arrow[r]& \OO_{\Delta} \arrow[r]& 0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
by $p^{*}E$ and apply the functor $q_{*}(-)$. Since the non-negativity
of $E$ implies that $R^{1}q_{*}(p^{*}E(-1,-1))=0$, we get
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r] &q_{*}(p^{*}E(-1,-1)) \arrow[r] & q_{*}(p^{*}E) \arrow[r] &
q_{*}(p^{*}(E))\otimes \OO_{\Delta} \arrow[r] & 0 
\end{tikzcd}
\]
which can be written as 
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
0\arrow[r] &\UL{H^{0}(E(-1))}(-1)
\arrow{rr}{\UL{y_{1}}x_{0}-\UL{y_{0}}x_{1}} && \UL{H^{0}(E)} \arrow[r]
&E \arrow[r] &0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
which proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

We now use the identifications coming from the Zariski framing to
rewrite the two maps
\[
x_{0},x_{1}: H^{0}(E(-1)) \to H^{0}(E)
\]
as
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow{r}{\begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ j  \end{pmatrix}} &A\oplus U,
\quad & A \arrow{r}{\begin{pmatrix} \Id_{A} \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}} &A\oplus U
\end{tikzcd}
\]
respectively. Then the exact sequence from Lemma~\ref{lem: Stromme}
reads
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: A(-1)->A+U->E}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3em]
  0
    \arrow[r]
  & \UL{A}(-1)
    \arrow[rr,"{%
      \begin{pmatrix}
        \UL{x}_{1}\alpha - \UL{x}_{0} \\[3pt]
        \UL{x}_{1}j
      \end{pmatrix}
    }"]
  && \UL{A}\oplus \UL{U}
    \arrow[r,"{(\UL{\beta},\UL{\theta})}"]
  & E
    \arrow[r]
  & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
and we see that $E$ can be reconstructed from $(\alpha ,j)$ as
the cokernal of $ \left(\begin{smallmatrix} \UL{x}_{1} \alpha -\UL{x}_{0}\\ 
\UL{x}_{1}j \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ and $\UL{\theta}:\UL{U}\to E$
can be reconstructed by restricting the quotient map to $\UL{U}$.

This proves the first part of the theorem. To prove the second part,
we observe that  $E$ is locally free if and only if
$ \left(\begin{smallmatrix} \UL{x}_{1} \alpha -\UL{x}_{0}\\ 
\UL{x}_{1}j \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ is bundle injective, namely for
each point $\lambda =\frac{x_{0}}{x_{1}}\in \PP^{1}-p_{\infty}$,
the vector space map ${\tiny \begin{pmatrix} \alpha -\lambda \Id_{A}\\
j \end{pmatrix}} : A\to A\oplus U $ is injective. This is equivalent
to condition \eqref{eqn: open condition involving ker j}.
\qed 

\begin{remark}\label{rem: linear control systems}
Although it has no bearing on this paper, it is amusing to note that
the stack in Theorem~\ref{thm: stack of Zariski framed sheaves is
equivalent to stack of quiver representation} is dual to the stack of
\emph{linear control systems} and the open condition \eqref{eqn: open
condition involving ker j} corresponds to so-called
\emph{controllable} linear control systems
\cite{Geiss-intro-to-moduli-quivers}.
\end{remark}


As discussed in the beginning of this section, points in $\LoopTwo
(\Gr (n,U\oplus W))$ are determined by the bundle $E$ and the
surjective map
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep={8em,between origins}]
\UL{U}\oplus \UL{W} \arrow{r}{(\UL{\theta },\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma})} &E .
\end{tikzcd}
\]
This is equivalent to the data of a Zariski framed bundle
$\UL{\theta}:\UL{U}\to E$ and a sheaf map $\UL{\gamma}:\UL{W}\to
E(-1)$ such that $\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma}$ surjects onto $Q$, the
cokernel of $\UL{\theta}$. Since $E$ is the quotient of a trivial
bundle, it has no negative summands and hence
$H^{1}(E(-1))=0$. Consequently $\UL{\gamma}$ determines and is
determined by its map on global sections:
\[
\gamma :W \to A.
\]

From the exact sequence \eqref{eqn: A(-1)->A+U->E}, we see that the
support of $Q$ occurs at points where $\UL{x}_{1}\alpha
-\UL{x}_{0}=0$, in other words where $x_{0}/x_{1}=\lambda $ is an
eigenvalue of $\alpha$. Thus the condition that $\UL{W}\to Q$ is
surjective is equivalent to
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: open condition with gamma}
\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\oplus \im (\gamma )=A \text{ for
all }\lambda\in \CC.
\end{equation}

This discussion yields a version of Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description
of Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))} which has a more explicit description of the open
condition:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: quiver description of Loop2(Gr(n,n+N))
with explicit stability condition}
Let $U$, $W$, and $A$ be vector spaces of dimension $n$, $N$, and
$d$. Let $V_{n,N,d} = \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U)\oplus \Hom (W,A)$ and let
$V^{\open}_{n,N,d}\subset V_{n,N,d}$ be the open set of $(\alpha ,j,\gamma )\in V$
satisfying Equations~\eqref{eqn: open condition involving ker j} and
\eqref{eqn: open condition with gamma}, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\cap \Ker (j) = 0$ for all
$\lambda\in \CC $.
\item  $\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\oplus  \im (\gamma )=A$ for
all $\lambda\in \CC $.
\end{enumerate}
Then the constructions of this section induce an isomorphism of affine
varieties:
\[
\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))\cong V^{\open}_{n,N,d}/GL(A) .
\]
\end{proposition}


\begin{remark}\label{rem: duality induced by Gr(n,n+N)=Gr(N,n+N)}
The isomorphism $\Gr (n,U\oplus W)\cong \Gr (N,U^{\vee}\oplus
W^{\vee})$ given by dualizing exact sequences induces an isomorphism
on the quiver side given by $(A,U,W)\mapsto
(A^{\vee},W^{\vee},U^{\vee})$ and $(\alpha ,j,\gamma )\mapsto
(\alpha^{\vee},\gamma^{\vee},j^{\vee})$. Note that the two open
conditions (1) and (2) are dual to each other under this equivalence. 
\end{remark}


To finish the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2alg(Gr(n,n+N))}, it remains to show that $V^{\open}_{n,N,d} =
V^{\stable}_{n,N,d}$. Stability for quivers is well understood going
back to work of King \cite{King-quivers} and continuing with the work
of Nakajima \cite{Nakajima-Duke88,Nakajima-Handsaw}. For the general
theory, stability depends on a choice of a linearization which is
determined in our case by a character $\chi : GL(A)\to \CC^{*}$ which
we may write $\chi (g) = \operatorname{det}(g)^{k}$. The three
different cases are $k<0$, $k=0$, $k>0$ and we are interested in the
trivial trivialization, namely $k=0$.

Using the Jordan decomposition of $\alpha$, it is easy to see that
condition (2) is equivalent to the condition that there does not exist
a non-trivial proper subspace $A'\subset A$ which is invariant under
$\alpha$ and contains the image of $\gamma$. Similarly, condition (1)
is equivalent to the condition that there does not exist a non-trivial
proper subspace $A'\subset A$ which is invariant under $\alpha$ and
contained in the kernel of $j$.


Condition (2) to be equivalent to GIT stability for the $k=1$
linearization \cite[Def.~2.2]{Nakajima-Handsaw}. As we observed in
Remark~\ref{rem: duality induced by Gr(n,n+N)=Gr(N,n+N)}, condition
(1) is dual to condition (2) and thus condition (1) is equivalent to
stability for the $k=-1$ linearization. For both $k=1$ and $k=-1$,
there are no strictly semi-stable points.

We are interested in the trivial linearization, $k=0$. In this case,
there are stictly semi-stable points, but the stable points are simple
representations: these are exactly those points satisfying both
conditions (1) and (2).

\section{Proof of Theorems~\ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(OGr)}}\label{sec: proofs of the Omega2(LG/OG) theorems}

Let 
\[
 \OGr (n,2n) = O(2n)/U(n), \quad \LGr (n,2n) = Sp(2n)/U(n)
\]
be the Maximal Isotropic Orthogonal Grassmannian and the Lagrangian
Grassmanian respectively. These parameterize $n$ dimensional isotropic
quotients of a $2n$ dimensional complex vector space equipped with an
orthogonal and a symplectic form respectively. Although we've written
these spaces as quotients of a compact Lie group by a subgroup, they
are also given by quotients of an algebraic group by a parabolic
subgroup and are therefore projective algebraic varieties. We will
handle these two cases simultaneously and so it will be convenient to
introduce the following notations:
\[
X_{+} = O(2n)/U(n), \quad X_{-} = Sp(2n)/U(n).
\]

If $V$ is a $2n$ dimensional vector space equipped with a
non-degenerate orthogonal respectively symplectic form $\omega$, then a
quotient
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
V \arrow[r,  two heads, "f"] & L
\end{tikzcd}
\]
is by definition \emph{maximal isotropic} respectively \emph{Lagrangian} if $L$ is
$n$ dimensional and $\omega |_{\Ker f} = 0$. 

Associated to the form $\omega$ is an isomorphism
\[
J : V\to V^{\vee } 
\]
satisfying $J^{\vee} = J$ respectively $J^{\vee}=-J$. The following
lemma is fairly well known (e.g. \cite[\S~2]{Hitching-2007}):
\begin{lemma}\label{lem: lagrangian quotient condition as a ses}
A linear map $f:V\to L$ is a maximal isotropic or Lagrangian quotient if
and only if the following sequence is short exact:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep={6em,between origins}]
0 \arrow[r] &
L^{\vee } \arrow[r, "J^{-1}\circ f^{\vee}"] &
V \arrow[r, "f"] &
L \arrow[r] &
0
\end{tikzcd}
\]
\end{lemma}


Let $U$ be an $n$ dimensional vector space and let 
\[
J_{\pm}: U\oplus U^{\vee} \to U^{\vee}\oplus U
\]
where 
\[
J_{\pm} = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & \pm 1_{U^{\vee }}\\
        1_{U} & 0
      \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Then $J_{\pm}$ induces an orthogonal/symplectic form on $U\oplus
U^{\vee}$ and so by the lemma, $\Xpm$ parameterizes short exact
sequences of the form
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep={6em,between origins}]
0 \arrow[r] &
L^{\vee } \arrow[r, "J_{\pm }^{-1}\circ f^{\vee}"] &
U\oplus U^{\vee } \arrow[r, "f"] &
L \arrow[r] &
0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The space $\Xpm$ has a natural base point given by the sequence
\[
0\to U^{\vee}\to U\oplus U^{\vee} \to U\to 0
\]
where the maps are the natural inclusions and projections.

With the above discussion, we see that the algebraic double loop space
$\LoopTwo(\Xpm )$ parameterizes short exact sequences of
bundles on $\PP^{1}$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: Evee-->U+Uvee-->E}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep={6em,between origins}]
0 \arrow[r] &
E^{\vee } \arrow[r, "J_{\pm }^{-1}\circ \UL{f}^{\vee}"] &
\UL{U}\oplus \UL{U}^{\vee } \arrow[r, "\UL{f}"] &
E \arrow[r] &
0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where the bundle $E$ has rank $n$ and degree $d$ and the map $\UL{f}$,
restricted to $p_{\infty} = (1:0)$ is 0 on the $U^{\vee}$ factor. In
keeping with the notation of Section~\ref{sec: Zariski framed sheaves,
quivers, and proof of Loop2(Gr) theorem} we may then write
\[
\UL{f} = (\UL{\theta},\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma})
\]
where $\UL{\theta}:\UL{U}\to E$ and $\UL{\gamma}:\UL{U}^{\vee}\to
E(-p_{\infty}).$ We then have
\[
J_{\pm}^{-1}\circ \UL{f}^{\vee} = \begin{pmatrix} \UL{\gamma}^{\vee}\UL{x}_{1} \\
\pm \UL{\theta}^{\vee}  \end{pmatrix}
\]
and we may re-express the condition $\UL{f}\circ J_{\pm}^{-1}\circ
\UL{f}^{\vee}=0$ as

\begin{equation}\label{eqn: theta gammadual x1 = mp x1 gamma thetadual}
\UL{\theta}\, \UL{\gamma}^{\vee}\, \UL{x}_{1} =  \mp \UL{x}_{1}\, 
\UL{\gamma}\,  \UL{\theta}^{\vee }.
\end{equation}

The above discussion has then proved the following intermediate result:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop: Loop2(Xpm) is a closed set in
Loop(Gr(n,2n)) satisfying condition involving theta and gamma}
$\LoopTwo (\Xpm )$ is the closed subset of $\LoopTwo (\Gr(2n,n))\cong
V^{\open}_{n,n,d}/GL(A)$ given by Equation~\eqref{eqn: theta gammadual x1
= mp x1 gamma thetadual}. 
\end{proposition}

Our strategy to prove theorems \ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(OGr)} is
to translate the sheaf theoretic condition given by
Equation~\eqref{eqn: theta gammadual x1 = mp x1 gamma thetadual} into
the language of the quiver data $(A,\alpha ,j,\gamma )$. This
translation will involve constructing a non-degenerate bilinear form
$\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$ such that the closed condition is equivalent to
the following equations
\begin{align}\label{eqns: closed conditions}
\phi^{\vee}&= \mp \phi \nonumber \\ 
\phi \alpha &=\alpha^{\vee}\phi \\
\phi \gamma &= - j^{\vee}. \nonumber 
\end{align}
This will allow us to eliminate $\gamma$ from the quiver data and
reduce the structure group from $GL(A)$ to $GL(A,\phi )$.

We begin by defining $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$. Recall that $A =
H^{0}(E(-1))$. Tensoring the sequence \eqref{eqn:
Evee-->U+Uvee-->E} by $\OO (-1)$ we get
\[
0\to E^{\vee}(-1)\to (\UL{U}\oplus \UL{U}^{\vee})(-1)\to E(-1)\to 0.
\]
Since $\OO (-1)$ has no non-trivial cohomology, the long exact
sequence associated to the above short exact sequence consists of a
single isomorphism $H^{0}(E(-1))\to H^{1}(E^{\vee}(-1))$. We define
$\phi$ to be the composition of this isomorphism with the Serre
duality isomorphism: 
\[
\phi : A = H^{0}(E(-1))\to H^{1}(E^{\vee}(-1)) \to H^{0}(E(-1))^{\vee}=A^{\vee}.
\]

\begin{lemma}\label{lem: phivee = mp phi}
The above isomorphism satisfies $\phi^{\vee} = \mp \phi$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Grothendieck-Verdier duality \cite[Eq~3.20]{Huybrechts-FMbook} states
that if $\pi :X\to Y$ is a morphism of smooth schemes and the
dualizing functor on $D^{b}(\operatorname{Coh}(X))$ is defined by 
\[
\DD_{X}(F^{\bullet}) = (F^{\bullet})^{\vee} \otimes \omega_{X}[\dim X ]
\]
then
\[
\Rpistar \circ \DD_{X} \homotopyeq  \DD_{Y}\circ \Rpistar .
\]

We let $Y=pt$ and $X=\PP^{1}$ and let 
\[
F^{\bullet} = [\UL{U}(-1)\stackrel{\UL{\theta}}{\longrightarrow } E(-1)]
\]
where this two term complex is supported in degrees $-1$ and $0$. Then
\[
\DD_{\PP^{1}}F^{\bullet} = [E^{\vee}(-1)\stackrel{\UL{\theta}^{\vee
}}{\longrightarrow } \UL{U}^{\vee}(-1)] .
\]

Note that $\Rpistar F^{\bullet}=A$ a vector space considered as a
complex supported in degree 0.

We will repeatedly use the following general fact from homological
algebra:
\bigskip

\begin{quote}
\emph{A short exact sequence with a split middle term is equivalent to
a quasi-isomorphism of a pair of two term complexes}\footnote{A short
exact sequence with a split middle term is the total complex of a 2x2
double complex and since the total complex is acyclic, the spectral
sequence of the double complex implies the vertical maps induce a
quasi-isomorphism of the rows.}.
\end{quote}
\bigskip

So for example, the short exact sequence

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em]
0 \arrow[r]
& E^{\vee}
  \arrow[r,"{%
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \UL{\gamma}^{\vee}\UL{x}_{1} \\[2pt]
      \pm\,\UL{\theta}^{\vee}
    \end{pmatrix}
  }"]
& \UL{U}\oplus \UL{U}^{\vee}
  \arrow[r,"{(\:\UL{\theta}\,,\,\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma}\:)}"]
& E \arrow[r]
& 0
\end{tikzcd}
\]

is equivalent to the following quasi-isomorphism of two-term complexes:


\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em,row sep=4em]
  \UL{U}(-1)
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\theta }"]
  & E(-1)
  & F^{\bullet}
    \arrow[d,bend left=25,"\Phi=\Psi^{-1}   "]\\
  E^{\vee}(-1)
    \arrow[u,"\mp \UL{\gamma}^{\vee}\UL{x}_{1}"]
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\theta }^{\vee}"]
  & \UL{U}^{\vee }(-1)
    \arrow[u,"\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma }"]
  & \DD F^{\bullet}
    \arrow[u,"\Psi  "]
\end{tikzcd}
\]

The map of complexes on the left above is a quasi-isomorphism and
hence induces an isomorphism $\Psi :\DD F^{\bullet}\to F^{\bullet}$
in the derived category whose inverse we denote $\Phi$.

We remark that going from a short exact sequence to a map of two term
complexes introduces a sign which in the above is manifested by the
$\mp$ appearing on the left vertical arrow (as oppose to the $\pm$
appearing on the $\UL{\theta}^{\vee}$ in the sequence). This crucial
sign change is the origin of the form $\phi$ having the opposite sign
as $J_{\pm}$.

We apply $\DD (-)$ to the complex to get

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em,row sep=4em]
  \UL{U}^{\vee }(-1)
    \arrow[d,"\mp\UL{x}_{1} \UL{\gamma}"]
  & E^{\vee}(-1)
    \arrow[d,"\UL{\gamma }^{\vee } \UL{x}_{1}"]
    \arrow[l,"\UL{\theta }^{\vee}"]
  & \DD F^{\bullet}
    \arrow[d,"\DD \Psi  "]
  \\
  E(-1)
  & \UL{U}(-1)
    \arrow[l,"\UL{\theta }"]
  & F^{\bullet}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Rotating the diagram on the left by 180 degrees we see that $\DD \Psi
=\mp \Psi$ and consequently we have $\DD \Phi =\mp \Phi$. Applying
$\Rpistar $ to $\Phi$ we get
\[
\Rpistar \Phi : \Rpistar F^{\bullet} = A \to \Rpistar
\DD_{\PP^{1}}F^{\bullet}=\DD_{pt}\Rpistar F^{\bullet} = A^{\vee}.
\]
Unpacking the definitions we see that $\phi  = \Rpistar \Phi$ and so
\begin{align*}
\phi &=\Rpistar \Phi \\
&=\mp \Rpistar \DD_{\PP^{1}}\Phi \\
&=\mp \DD_{pt}\Rpistar \Phi \\
&=\mp \DD_{pt}\phi \\
&=\mp \phi^{\vee}
\end{align*}
which completes the proof of the Lemma.
\end{proof}
 
  
\begin{lemma}\label{lem: phi.alpha=alphavee.phi} The following
equation holds:
\[
\phi \alpha =\alpha^{\vee}\phi .
\]
\end{lemma}

\proof We let

\[
\UL{\sigma} = \UL{x}_{1}\alpha -\UL{x}_{0}
\]
and we twist the exact sequence \eqref{eqn: A(-1)->A+U->E} by $\OO
(-1)$ to obtain:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=3em]
  0
    \arrow[r]
  & \UL{A}(-2)
    \arrow[r,"{%
      \begin{pmatrix}
        \UL{\sigma } \\
        \UL{x}_{1}j
      \end{pmatrix}
    }"]
  & (\UL{A}\oplus \UL{U})(-1)
    \arrow[r,"{(\UL{\beta},\UL{\theta})}"]
  & E(-1)
    \arrow[r]
  & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\]

We now use the same homological algebra trick as in the proof of
Lemma~\ref{lem: phivee = mp phi} applied to the above to obtain:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em,row sep=4em]
  \UL{A}(-2)
    \arrow[d,"-\UL{x}_{1}j"]
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\sigma  }"]
  & \UL{A}(-1)
    \arrow[d,"\UL{\beta }"]
  & A^{\bullet }
    \arrow[d,"\JJ "]
  \\
  \UL{U}(-1)
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\theta }"]
  & E(-1)
  & F^{\bullet}
\end{tikzcd}
\]

We compose the derived category isomorphism $\JJ$ with the
isomorphisms $\Phi$ and $\DD \JJ$ to get an isomorphism
\[
\DD \JJ \circ \Phi \circ \JJ :A^{\bullet}\longrightarrow \DD A^{\bullet }
\]
which is realized by the following diagram of quasi-isomorphism:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn: big diagram}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em,row sep=4em]
  \UL{A}(-2)
    \arrow[d,"-\UL{x}_{1}j"]
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\sigma  }"]
  & \UL{A}(-1)
    \arrow[d,"\UL{\beta }"]
  & A^{\bullet }
    \arrow[d,"\JJ "]
  \\
  \UL{U}(-1)
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\theta }"]
  & E(-1)
  & F^{\bullet}
    \arrow[d,"\Phi"]\\
  E^{\vee}(-1)
    \arrow[d,"\UL{\beta}^{\vee}"]
    \arrow[u,"\mp \UL{\gamma}^{\vee}\UL{x}_{1}"]
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\theta }^{\vee}"]
  & \UL{U}^{\vee }(-1)
    \arrow[d,"-\UL{x}_{1}j^{\vee}"]
    \arrow[u,"\UL{x}_{1}\UL{\gamma }"]
  & \DD F^{\bullet}
    \arrow[d,"\DD \JJ "]\\
    \UL{A}^{\vee}(-1) 
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\sigma  }^{\vee}"]
  & \UL{A}^{\vee }
  & \DD A^{\bullet} 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

Recall that 
\[
\coker \UL{\theta} = Q
\]
is a zero dimensional sheaf supported on
$\PP^{1}-p_{\infty}=\operatorname{Spec}\CC [z]$ where
$z=x_{0}/x_{1}$. Considering the sheaf $Q$ as an object in
$D^{b}(\PP^{1})$ (concentrated in degree 0), we see that 
\[
F^{\bullet}\cong Q
\]
and consequently via $\JJ$ we also have 
\[
A^{\bullet}\cong Q.
\]
Let $\UL{\phi}=\DD \JJ \circ \Phi \circ \JJ$ and by the above diagrams
we see
\[
\UL{\phi}: Q\longrightarrow Q^{\vee}
\]
is an isomorphism. As the notation suggests, $\Rpistar \UL{\phi}=\phi$
(since $\Rpistar \JJ =1_{A}$).

Now since $Q$ and $Q^{\vee}$ are sheaves on $\operatorname{Spec}\CC
[z]$, we may regard the isomorphism $\UL{\phi }$ as a $\CC [z]$-module
isomorphism.

We note that the undelying vector space of the $\CC [z]$-module $Q$ is
$A$ and since $\UL{x}_{1}\alpha -\UL{x}_{0}=0$ on $\coker
\UL{\sigma}=Q$, we see that multiplication by $z=x_{0}/x_{1}$ is given
by $\alpha :A\to A$. Similarly, the underlying vector space of the
module $Q^{\vee}$ is $A^{\vee}$ and multiplication by $z$ is given by
$\alpha^{\vee}:A^{\vee}\to A^{\vee}$.

Since $\UL{\phi}:Q\to Q^{\vee}$ is a module isomorphism, the
underlying linear map of vector spaces $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$ commutes
with multiplication by $z$, namely
\[
\phi \alpha =\alpha^{\vee}\phi 
\]
which proves the lemma.\qed 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem: phi.gamma = -jvee}
The following holds
\[
\phi \gamma =-j^{\vee}.
\]
\end{lemma}
\proof
First, we note that the isomorphism $\UL{\phi}:A^{\bullet}\to \DD
A^{\bullet}$ can be realized as the following map of complexes:

\[

    \arrow[u,"\UL{\phi } "]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
since the induced sheaf isomorphism $\coker \UL{\sigma}\to \coker
\UL{\sigma}^{\vee}$ agrees with $\UL{\phi}$ on the underlying vector
spaces $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$.

Now by adding the cokernels to the complexes in the diagram
\eqref{eqn: big diagram}, we get a commutative diagram where the rows
are short exact sequences. Then tensoring this big diagram by $\OO
(1)$ and adding the bottom the above complex (and cokernel) we get the
following:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=6em,row sep=4em]
  \UL{A}^{\vee }(-1)
    \arrow[d,"-\UL{x}_{1}j"]
    \arrow[r,"\UL{\sigma  }"]
  & \UL{A}
    \arrow[d,"\UL{\beta }"]
    \arrow[r]
  & \coker \UL{\sigma }
    \arrow[d]

    \arrow[r]
  & \coker \UL{\sigma }
    \arrow[u]    
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}

We now take the long exact sequence in cohomology associated to each
row to get the following commutative diagram:

By commutativity of the square (1) and exactness of row 2, we see that
$B_{1}$ must be $(1_{A},0)$. Similarly, we see from commutativity of
square (4) and exactness of the 4th row, $B_{3}$ must be
$(\alpha^{\vee},1_{A^{\vee}})$. Then we can compute $B_{2}$ in two
different ways: by the composition around the sides and bottom of
square (3) and by the composition around the sides and top of square
(2). The result is

\[
B_{2} = \phi^{-1}\gamma  = -j^{\vee}.
\]
and the second equality is equivalent to the desired equality in the lemma.
\qed 

We are now in a position to complete the proof of Theorems~\ref{thm:
quiver description of Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver description
of Loop2Alg(OGr)}. Using Proposition~\ref{prop: Loop2(Xpm) is a closed set in
Loop(Gr(n,2n)) satisfying condition involving theta and gamma} along
with the construction of $\phi$ and Equations~\eqref{eqns: closed
conditions} which were proved in Lemmas~\ref{lem: phivee = mp phi} ,
\ref{lem: phi.alpha=alphavee.phi} , and \ref{lem: phi.gamma = -jvee},
we see that 
\[
\LoopTwo (\Xpm ) = W^{\open}_{\mp,n,d} / GL(A)
\]
where $W_{\mp ,n,d}$ is the set of
\[
(\alpha ,\gamma ,j,\phi )\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom
(U^{\vee},A)\oplus  \Hom (A,U)\times \operatorname{Isom}(A,A^{\vee})
\]
where Equations~\eqref{eqns: closed conditions} hold and $W^{\open}_{\mp
,n,d}\subset W_{\mp ,n,d}$ is the open set given by the conditions

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\cap \Ker (j) = 0$ for all
$\lambda$.
\item  $\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\oplus  \im (\gamma )=A$ for
all $\lambda$.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Since $GL(A)$ acts transitively on the space of symplectic/orthogonal
forms on $A$, we may \emph{fix} a form $\phi$ on $A$ and then quotient
instead by the stabilizer of $\phi$, namely
\[
G(A,\phi ) = \{g\in GL(A)\,:\, g^{\vee}\phi g=\phi \}.
\]

Since $\phi$ is invertible, we may eliminate $\gamma$ using the
equation $\gamma =-\phi^{-1} j^{\vee}$. Thus we get
\[
\LoopTwo (\Xpm ) = V_{\mp ,n,d}^{\open}/G(A,\phi )
\]
where $(A,\phi )$ is a $d$ dimensional vector space equipped with a
non-degenerate form $\phi :A\to A^{\vee}$, $\phi^{\vee}=\mp \phi$,
\[
V_{\mp ,n,d} = \{(\alpha ,j)\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U),\quad \phi
\alpha =\alpha^{\vee}\phi \}, 
\]
and $V^{\open}_{\mp, n,d}\subset V_{\mp, n,d}$ is the open set satifying

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\cap \Ker (j) = 0$ for all
$\lambda$.
\item  $\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\oplus  \im (\phi^{-1}j^{\vee} )=A$ for
all $\lambda$.
\end{enumerate}
  
\bigskip

Condition (2) above is equivalent to condition (1). Indeed, we have
the following equivalences of conditions
\begin{align*}
\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\oplus  \im (\phi^{-1}j^{\vee} )&=A
\text{ for all } \lambda \iff \\
\im (\phi \alpha\phi^{-1} -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A^{\vee }})\oplus  \im
(j^{\vee} )&=A^{\vee }
\text{ for all } \lambda \iff \\
\im (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A^{\vee }})\oplus  \im
(j^{\vee} )&=A^{\vee }
\text{ for all } \lambda \iff \\
\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot \Id_{A})\cap \Ker (j) &= 0 \text{ for all } \lambda .
\end{align*}
The first equivalence uses the isomorphism $\phi$, the second
equivalence uses the equation $\phi \alpha  = \alpha^{\vee}\phi$, and
the third and four conditions are equivalent by duality.

Thus we have proved the following version of Theorems \ref{thm: quiver
description of Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(OGr)} with a more explicit description of the open condition:
\begin{proposition}\label{prop: quiver description of Loop2Alg(Xpm)
with explicit open condition}
Let $U$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ and let $(A,\phi )$ be a
$d$ dimensional vector space equipped with a non-degenerate form $\phi
:A\to A^{\vee}$ satisfying $\phi^{\vee}=\mp \phi$. Let
\[
V_{\mp ,n,d} = \{(\alpha ,j)\in \Hom (A,A)\oplus \Hom (A,U):\quad \phi
\alpha =\alpha^{\vee}\phi \}
\]
and let $V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d}\subset V_{\mp ,n,d}$ be the open set given
by the condition
\[
\Ker (\alpha -\lambda \cdot 1_{A})\cap \Ker (j) = 0\text{ for all } \lambda \in \CC .
\]
Then there is a natural isomorphism
\[
\LoopTwo (\Xpm ) = V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d}/G(A,\phi )
\]
where $G(A,\phi ) = \{g\in GL(A): g^{\vee}\phi g = \phi \}$. 
\end{proposition}

To complete the proof of Theorems \ref{thm: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(OGr)}, it
remains to show that $V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d} = V^{\stable }_{\mp ,n,d}$
where $V^{\stable }_{\mp ,n,d}$ is the locus of GIT stable points for
the action of $G(A,\phi )$ on $V_{\mp ,n,d}$. To do this it will be
convenient to geometrically identify the full stack quotient $[V_{\mp
,n,d} / G(A,\phi )]$.

Revisiting the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop: quiver description of
Loop2Alg(Xpm) with explicit open condition} in the absence of the open
condition, we find that the stack $[V_{\mp ,n,d} / G(A,\phi )]$ is
equivalent to the stack of complexes on $\PP^{1}$ of the form
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep={6em,between origins}]
E^{\vee } \arrow[r, "J_{\pm }^{-1}\circ \UL{f}^{\vee}"] &
\UL{U}\oplus \UL{U}^{\vee } \arrow[r, "\UL{f}"] & E,
\end{tikzcd}
\]
(standard over $p_{\infty}$), exact in the middle, but where $E$ is no
longer necessarily locally free and $\UL{f}$ is no longer necessarily
surjective. Note that for self-dual sequences of the above form,
$\UL{f}$ is surjective if and only if $E$ is locally free (indeed,
this is the equivalence of conditions (1) and (2) proven above). It
follows that $E$ is locally free if and only if the sequence has no
non-trivial automorphisms. Moreover, the automorphism group of the
sequence is trivial if and only if it is finite. Thus the open set
$V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d}$ is precisely the locus where $G(A,\phi )$ acts
freely (or equivalently with finite automorphisms).

Now a point $(\alpha ,j)\in V_{\mp ,n,d}$ is GIT stable for the
$G(A,\phi )$ action if and only if the orbit $G(A,\phi )\cdot (\alpha
,j)$ is closed and $(\alpha ,j)$ has finite stabilizer. Thus in
particular, $V^{\stable}_{\mp ,n,d}\subset V^{\open}_{\mp
,n,d}$. Conversely, if $(\alpha ,j)\in V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d}$, then the
corresponding point $(\alpha ,j,-\phi^{-1}j^{\vee})\in V_{n,n,d}$ is in
$V^{\open}_{n,n,d}=V^{\stable}_{n,n,d}$ and hence the $GL(A)$ orbit is
closed in $V_{n,n,d}$. Since $G(A,\phi )\subset GL(A)$ is a closed
subgroup, it follows that the orbit $G(A,\phi )\cdot (\alpha
,j,-\phi^{-1}j^{\vee})$ is closed in $V_{n,n,d}$ and hence $G(a,\phi
)\cdot (\alpha ,j)$ is closed in $V_{\mp ,n,d}$. Since we know points
in $V^{\open}_{\mp ,n,d}$ have finite stabilizers, it follows that
$(\alpha ,j)$ is $G(A,\phi )$ stable and thus $V^{\open}_{\mp
,n,d}\subset V^{\stable }_{\mp ,n,d}$ which proves $V^{\open}_{\mp
,n,d}=V^{\stable }_{\mp ,n,d}$ and completes the proofs of Theorems
\ref{thm: quiver description of Loop2Alg(LGr)} and \ref{thm: quiver
description of Loop2Alg(OGr)}. \qed 

\section{Details of the topological argument.}\label{sec: topological details}


\begin{comment}
~~~~OLD TOPOLOGICAL ARGUMENT:

This stuff might eventually get moved :

\section{Topological consequences of the theorem}\label{sec:
topological consequences}

In this subsection, we make precise the assertion in Remark~\ref{rem:
Gr(n,n+N) is a model for BGL(n) and Vo/GL(A) is a model for
BGL(d)}. We work over $\CC$ and we give our varieties the analytic
topology. Then since $\PP^{1}$ is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere
$S^{2}$, there is a natural inclusion
\[
\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))\hookrightarrow \LoopTwoTop  (\Gr (n,n+N))
\]
where the space on the right is the usual loop-2 space of continuous
based maps $f:S^{2}\to \Gr (n,n+N)$.

In \cite{Mann-Milgram-93}, Mann and Milgram study the above inclusion
and prove that it induces a homotopy equivalence through dimension
$2d+1$ (and that moreover this bound is sharp). In other words we have
an isomorphism of homotopy groups for all $k<2d+1$:
\begin{align*}
\pi_{k}(\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))) &\cong \pi_{k}(\LoopTwoTop (\Gr (n,n+N)))\\
&\cong \pi_{k+2}(\Gr (n,n+N)).
\end{align*}

Without loss of generality, we now assume that $N\geq n$. We then can
easily prove that 
\[
\pi_{k+2}(\Gr (n,n+N))\cong \pi_{k+1}(U(n)) \text{ for all $k<2n-1$}
\]
using the long exact homotopy sequences associated to the standard
fibrations 
\begin{align*}
U(n-1)\hookrightarrow &U(n) \to S^{2n-1}\\
U(n)\times U(N) \hookrightarrow & U(n+N)  \to \Gr (n,n+N).
\end{align*}

Combining the above we have
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: pik(loop2alg)=pik+1(U(n))}
\pi_{k}(\LoopTwo (\Gr (n,n+N))) \cong \pi_{k+1}(U(n)) \text{  for all
} k<\min (2n-1,2d+1).
\end{equation}


On the other hand, we may analyze the homotopy groups of the quiver
variety $V^{\open}/GL(A)$ using the long exact homotopy sequence of the
fibration
\[
GL(A)\hookrightarrow V^{\open} \to V^{\open}/GL(A). 
\]
Now $V^{\open} = V-Z$ and the inclusion $V^{\open} \hookrightarrow V$ induces
isomorphisms on $\pi_{k}$ for all $k< 2\codim(Z)-1$
\cite[Prop~7.1]{Anderson-Fulton} and so the long exact sequence
\[
\pi_{k}(V^{\open})\to \pi_{k}(V^{\open}/GL(A)) \to \pi_{k-1}(GL(A)) \to \pi_{k-1}(V^{\open})
\]
gives isomorphisms
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: pik(Vo/GL(A)) = pik-1(GL(A))}
\pi_{k}(V^{\open}/GL(A))\cong \pi_{k-1}(GL(A)) \text{  for all $k<2\codim Z
-1$}.
\end{equation}
Then since $GL(A)$ is homotopy equivalent to $U(d)$,
equations~\eqref{eqn: pik(Vo/GL(A)) = pik-1(GL(A))} and \eqref{eqn:
pik(loop2alg)=pik+1(U(n))}, along with Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver
description of loop2 of Gr} yields
\begin{equation}\label{eqn: main homotopy equivalence with one
superfluous condition}
\pi_{k+1}(U(n))\cong \pi_{k-1}(U(d))\text{   for all   } k\leq \min
(2n-1,2d+1, 2\codim Z - 1).
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
$\codim Z \geq N$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\emph{(Sketch)} By definition $Z=Z_{1}\cap Z_{2} $ where
\begin{align*}
Z_{1}&= \left\{(\alpha ,j,\gamma ): \text{$\Ker j$ contains an
eigenvector of $\alpha$}.  \right\}\\
Z_{2}&= \left\{(\alpha ,j,\gamma ): \text{$\Coker \gamma  $ contains an
eigenvector of $\alpha$}.  \right\}.
\end{align*}
The codimension of $Z_{1}\subset V$ is the same as the codimension of
$\Ker j \subset A$ which is $n$. By duality, the codimension of
$Z_{2}$ is $N$. The expected codimension of $Z$ is then $n+N$, but we
can certainly conclude that $\codim Z\geq \max (n,N)=N$.
\end{proof}
The Lemma means that $2n-1\leq 2\codim Z-1$ and so \eqref{eqn: main
homotopy equivalence with one superfluous condition} simplifies to
give us the main topological consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver
description of loop2 of Gr}: 
\begin{proposition}\label{prop: main homotopy equivalence}
The isomorphism of varieties in Theorem~\ref{thm: quiver description
of loop2 of Gr} induces homotopy equivalences:
\[
\pi_{k+1}(U(n))\cong \pi_{k-1}((U(d))
\]
for all $k\leq \min (2n-1,2d+1)$.
\end{proposition}
The above then immediately implies the classical Bott periodicity for
$U=\lim_{n\to \infty}U(n)$:
\begin{corollary}
$\pi_{k+1}(U)\cong \pi_{k-1}(U)$ for all $k$ and moreover,
$\pi_{k}(U(n))\cong \pi_{k}(U) $ for all $k\leq 2n$.
\end{corollary}
